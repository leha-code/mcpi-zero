# mcpi-zero
This is a wrapper that is going to simplify the use of mcpi.minecrft:
instead of using mc.postToChat('string msg') you will be using chat('string msg')
and other ways,

# TEASERS
place instead of setBlock
start instead of Minecraft.create
playersList instead of mc.getPlayerEntityIds()
and more...
